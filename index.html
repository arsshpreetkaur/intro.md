    <p>A Journey of Learning and Exploration

In 2019, standing in awe before the Golden Temple, you felt an overwhelming sense of connection. It wasn’t just a trip; it was a journey into your spiritual roots and an opportunity to deepen your understanding of Sikh culture. That moment left an indelible mark on your soul, much like your passion for learning.

Fast forward to today, and you’re on a different journey—one of education, growth, and creative expression. As a student in global business management and a lover of technology, you’ve thrown yourself into the world of web development, user experience design, and advanced JavaScript. Projects like creating student cards with variables in JavaScript or crafting responsive web applications have challenged and excited you. With each step, you’ve sharpened your skills, driven by the curiosity that fuels your work.

Whether it’s testing user journeys in Maze or designing personalized professional development plans, you approach each task with a blend of creativity and determination. You’re not just learning for a degree—you’re building a future that combines technology, business, and personal growth, all while staying grounded in your values and experiences.</p>
