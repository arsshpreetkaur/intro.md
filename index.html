            <p>
                In May 2023, I embarked on an incredible adventure to Canada to pursue my dream of studying Interactive Media Design. 
                Moving to a new country has been both exciting and challenging, but it has also been a time of immense personal growth. 
                From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with the warm hospitality that Canada is known for, and I quickly began adapting to my new environment.

                The decision to move to Canada wasn't easy, but it has turned out to be one of the most rewarding choices of my life. 
                Every day brings new experiences, whether it's discovering the city's vibrant culture, exploring beautiful landscapes, or engaging in interactive media projects that challenge my skills and push me to new heights.
